			<p> Patton's death was not one that was expected from the crash he was involved in. Known as "Old Blood and Guts" by his soilders. The only one hurt in this crash was Patton, depite there being several other people in the limousine. Along with him being the only one hurt in the crash. Patton requested a guared to be posted outside of his hospital room despite being the most revered general in Europe. Additionally, after his death there was <b> no autopsy.</b> According to <a href="https://nypost.com/2010/12/19/was-patton-killed/"><u>the NY Post</u></a> "all reports and subsequent investigations of the crash-and there were at least five- have vanished" (Wilcox, 2010). For all these reasons there are many out there that believe that General Patton was murdered for his view on post war policy and that the government is hiding the evidence to prove that Patton was murdered.</p>
